/**
 * Letâ€™s say that Amazon surprises customers on a periodic basis where it gives each customer some credit (X amount) that can be used to buy 2 products from a curated list of products.
 * The credit has to be used completely in one transaction and you can only buy 2 products. Come up with a solution to identify which two products would exactly match the credit.
 *
 *
 * Candidate just needs to know what a transaction is and what product is - even knowing what amazon does/interacts is not needed to complete
 * There are multiple ways to solve this, you could do brute force, you could do backpacking (a little dynamic programming), maybe even searching algorithm
 *
 * Follow up
 * FUQ (Q1): Which two products would maximize the credit utilization (does not need to exactly match) - be able to walk through this and write some code as a bar raising SDE II
 * FUQ (Q2): Generalize it for any number to buying n products (rarely there is time to discuss this or reach this point). - be able to at least explain it, if time write some code

/*
This is basically Two Sums:
Qs:
- Input List of Integers + a Integer for credit: Assume yes
- There will be Two Integers Sum = Credit: yes
- Output is the 2 indexes of the List? Yes
  - Multiple ans? No, one is enough
- O(?) time and space requirement? Just get a solution for now.
- Are the List sorted? No
  - If yes, then two pointers method can achieve O(n) time.
- Duplicate numbers? No

Follow up: Closest Two Sum
- Can the sum > target? Assume yes

FUQ (Q2): Generalize it for any number to buying n products (rarely there is time to discuss this or reach this point). - be able to at least explain it, if time write some code
- This is Dynamic Programming problem, see KSum.java
- store possible combination from 0 - target, and use the previous combo to find target solution
